**Project Description**

The project BSA is pursuing is an interactive business simulation project that aims to provide a framework for teaching and testing business concepts.

The project will allow a user to create their own company in the simulation and manage it in a simulated global market. The user can then gauge and test marketing and business principles to simulate how they would work in a real world scenario.

This product is aimed at both students of business as well as experienced business analysts to both teach and create a testing environment for new business practices. This product will allow the user to get a sense of how well their business proposal will perform before deployment.

The user can interact with the simulation and change various environmental variables to emulate any real-world scenario they desire. This will allow the user to gauge at low cost how well a particular business plan will perform in a simulated market.

**Functionalities**

To create this simulation environment our front-end design will utilize THREE.js - a 3D graphics library for javascript. The front end of the application will allow users to interact with the simulation and change a set amount of environmental variables to create and simulate a business organization.

The back end of the organization will utilize JSON data files that will provide the real world variables that will make up the backbone of the simulation.

All the simulation processes will be computed in the backend of the application and will be based on market research and business principles. The simulation algorithms will be protected and maintained by BSA to be as accurate as possible to its real world counterparts.

To demonstrate an example of a concept that could be implemented in our game, we thought up a marketing mechanic. Marketing would involve the image surrounding a product in which the player will be given choices to boost the visibility and reputation of their new product. If the product lacks visibility, sales will not occur; if the product has a bad reputation, sales will not occur. It is important to keep these two balanced in order to ensure that the product generates profit.

**Intended Audience and Benefits**

Primary intended audience would be business students who want to learn and implement business strategies in a virtual environment. It can also be used by the teacher to help students understand business concepts better, such as planning, implementing, monitoring, etc.

The primary benefit of exploring marketing strategies in a virtual environment is that it presents virtually no financial risk and allows a prospective business analyst to experiment and learn about marketing in a larger simulated scale environment than is typically offered in a classroom. Also, they can implement their strategies as many times as they want until they get a satisfied strategy that they can reference in real life.

The simulation will be an interactive way for students of business to have a taste of what it's like to grow a successful company and what they may encounter. It is necessary to be considerate with the level of complexity this business simulation will possess in order to prevent issues with overcomplication on our end regarding the deadline and the user in regards to information overload.

The goal of the simulation is to make the most responsible and effective business choices to grow the company and accrue as much profit as possible whilst in the midst of competitors. In business, there are many key aspects to consider in reaching success, with such aspects ranging from marketing to managing and finance. By managing all these successfully, victory can be achieved.
